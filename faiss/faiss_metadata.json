"What tools do you use for monitoring and alerting?"}, {"text": "Q: Perfect. So thank you Ana for agreeing, and would you like to expand on your field of research? And what are the typical research methods you use for gathering and data?\nA: Yes, I am doing my PhD where I'm looking at, basically, I'm looking at documents on the one hand. I did interviews, and I did also workshops. So that is yeah data collection\u2026", "next_question": "The methods."}, {"text": "Q: The methods.\nA: \u2026but I don't like to call it that, data collection, because it was more like - step from the documents about the interviews and the worships - were more like co-production of knowledge. So interviews were not only semi structured, but more like dialogical interviews. Um, so yeah, the concept of data gathering is not, you know, it doesn't, in my opinion, it doesn't really convey what I was doing?", "next_question": "Yeah. Okay, perfect. And, and what are the, what are your methods and what method you use to analyse your data, and what type of tools or software did you use?"}, {"text": "Q: Yeah. Okay, perfect. And, and what are the, what are your methods and what method you use to analyse your data, and what type of tools or software did you use?\nA: What I'm doing to analyse the data is, I'm doing mostly, kind of mapping and diagrams. So also, because I don't want to, I think that a lot, often-times, when you do an analysis of an interview what people end up doing is a quantitative analysis of how many times a certain word has appeared. As I say, this is, this is not what I'm doing. But, I'm doing more, is trying to understand from my own experience, being part of the municipalists movement. I'm from my own experience of being part of processes that we're creating comments, and from my own experience of being [an] urban planner, I'm trying to see the elements that on the one hand resonates with my experience, but on the other hand also resonates with a certain political priority and this political priority is the politically processes of the commons which entails transformation of the way institutions work. But not only public institutions, but also social institutions. And what I'm trying to figure out is what are the new elements that, then, are, should be incorporated into the . To say, I don't use software. I do analysis by hand. I am doing, well, diagrams, relational mapping on the one hand, and it\u2019s relation with documents, which is the less, obviously, it's not copyright news. I would say in this specific case to a certain degree\u2026", "next_question": "Mm-hmm."}, {"text": "Q: Mm-hmm.\nA: \u2026because those documents came from a political social act. Listen, where I was part[ner] with other college part of it. So it's not like it's so detached from my own experience. But there, what I'm doing is something called \u2018knowledge graph\u2019. And, it\u2019s, um, yeah something that is applied to databases, but I'm doing it also you know, it's a small set of data, let's say, so I just, I had manually. So, I used the\u2026", "next_question": "Mm-hmm. That's very interesting."}, {"text": "Q: Mm-hmm. That's very interesting.\nA: I mostly use InDesign. I'm sorry, Illustrator, to draw\u2026", "next_question": "Mmm. Okay. Yeah. So you're doing them by hand and\u2026"}, {"text": "Q: Mmm. Okay. Yeah. So you're doing them by hand and\u2026\nA: \u2026so I'm wrong.", "next_question": "\u2026then you're passing them, or digitalizing them with Illustrator, in Illustrator?"}, {"text": "Q: \u2026then you're passing them, or digitalizing them with Illustrator, in Illustrator?\nA: \u2026yeah, either they make right,\u2026", "next_question": "\u2018...sort of\u2026"}, {"text": "Q: \u2018...sort of\u2026\nA: \u2026sometimes throw directly into Illustrator, and sometimes I, I do, I draw them by hand, and then I put in a Illustrator on the top. Yeah. But, for example, on the workshops I was doing, the diagrams when we were doing the workshop. So for me, doing the diagrams, it's a way of thinking. so, you know, like, I think that there is also - often this idea - that you have data and then you apply, it's like a machine, right? Like you are gathering things so you up all your, you know\u2026", "next_question": "Hmm."}, {"text": "Q: Hmm.\nA: \u2026like, yeah, whatever materials here, and then you apply an analysis, which is like the machine, and then, and then something comes out. That's not my, I mean my analysis are much more craft. That's it, amazing, and\u2026", "next_question": "That sounds really interesting, and what, you mentioned a little bit of some of the theories you are using, but which is your analytical framework or your theoretical framework?"}, {"text": "Q: That sounds really interesting, and what, you mentioned a little bit of some of the theories you are using, but which is your analytical framework or your theoretical framework?\nA: The theoretical framework I'm using? Well, yeah, that depends on, you mean, on the methods of analysis or the theoretical framework for the, because I think that there is a mix on the methods of analysis, I am using, like, a very personal version of grounded theory, which means I have, it's an inductive-deductive\u2026", "next_question": "Hmm."}, {"text": "Q: Hmm.\nA: \u2026methodology. I come to the field with my own ideas and assumptions. And yeah, not only aims and objectives, but also, like, kind of an idea of what is happening, because I have previous experience. Then I did, I did the analysis through the, let's call it that gathering. That means that, when I did the first analysis of the documents, and out of that analysis then I decided what to do with the interviews, and out of the interviews then I decided what to do with the method. So, I have three phases, and the three phases are iterative, where each of the phases depends on the first one. And the first one depends on my own experience, which could be like, we call it phase zero. So this is like, like this will be like, the theoretical framework of - the how I did the project. But how I treat the results, I am using more actor-network theory. And specifically,\u2026", "next_question": "Mm-hmm."}, {"text": "Q: Mm-hmm.\nA: \u2026I am applying concept developed by Isabelle Stengers, which is called, and she proposes an Ecology of Practices.

Okay.\nA: But that, this elements that she mentions, which is Technologies of Belonging, Strategies of challenges, and diplomacy, and Fostering and empowerment. And she also worked with the concept of a cause. So I'm trying to see what are the ecology of practices that municipalists, and in the institution, and social actors. How, yeah, how they were interacting on these, producing of urban commons - and that in itself was an ecology of practices that are different, and there is a new emerging ecology. So there was like the practice of the institution, on one hand, the practice of social movements as it was, and then a new practice that it is this new practice like oh, then becoming one of the public.", "next_question": "And that's really good. It's really interesting. And what is your experience with working with qualitative data in your usual research?"}, {"text": "Q: And that's really good. It's really interesting. And what is your experience with working with qualitative data in your usual research?\nA: um, well, as I said, I think that qualitative data is, I would say it's more complicated to me to work with, because if I would do a machine, or you know, some other analysis of data, well, that's complicated. I mean I'm not saying like, I think, I mean all this could be. I have friends who do discursive analysis. For example, I'm not you know, like trying to imply that the language, natural language programming, is easy - because it is not. It's very complicated. But I think that somehow [Name Redacted] research, it is much more solid to say \u201cI have these numbers\u201d. You know, this is a, this is - nine is more than eight, you know, you have it. And so\u2026", "next_question": "Yeah."}, {"text": "Q: Yeah.\nA: \u2026I think that, for me, precisely one, one of the characteristics of qualitative data is that it cannot be quantified. And when it cannot be quantified, it is complicated to apply for me software that then tries to count things. Or to put numbers to it. And, and, to that degree, I think that we are closer or lately, I have found that anthropologies class much more this capacity of taking, you know, the textures and the nature of the thing in another way, right? So, yeah, I think for me, that's it. It's like, I feel like, for the things that I'm doing, the tools provided by a more, let's say traditional social science approach, all right, [are] a little bit yeah, not so well designed for this...", "next_question": "Mm-hmm."}, {"text": "Q: Mm-hmm.\nA: \u2026and maybe I'm more of [an] anthropological approach will happen\u2026", "next_question": "Okay."}, {"text": "Q: Okay.\nA: \u2026just for some, yeah.", "next_question": "And that's very interesting. Yeah. And what is, no, I agree with you! I also think, like, coming from a quantitative background. I also found working with qualitative data more challenging, because, like, you say, you cannot quantify really. So, yeah, you have to find another way of approaching it, and when you\u2026"}, {"text": "Q: And that's very interesting. Yeah. And what is, no, I agree with you! I also think, like, coming from a quantitative background. I also found working with qualitative data more challenging, because, like, you say, you cannot quantify really. So, yeah, you have to find another way of approaching it, and when you\u2026\nA: I think that the interpretation of the data is, it's not so straightforward, and I think that  - which might not, might not be the next question - is what makes it also difficult to make it open? Because you have to explain everything like, you know, like if you do some of the, kind of data, and then you know, like, the golden stand here will be, in the laboratory. It's something that assumes that there is this neutrality. And actually, it is a positivist, you know, position. But it makes it easy, yeah, because you could say \u201cThis is my data\u201d. So \u201cThis is my sheet, this is my database, this is the software I have to apply. This is what has come out of these analyses\u201d. Good. But if I have to do this with my own analysis, I have to explain - \u201cWhat is my background, what I thought these with, what is the - what is [indecipherable]? But this is coming back then [to] how I have interpreted these, why these things I am not looking at. So just in mind that you do this with 50 interviews, that I have, I mean, it's just, it's not possible. Like, I will spend the three years just explaining what I'm doing. So, not feasible.", "next_question": "Yeah. Yeah. I agree. And what is your, well, you talk a little bit about this. But what is your perception, and if you have any practice of doing open research, or we do with open research in general."}, {"text": "Q: Yeah. Yeah. I agree. And what is your, well, you talk a little bit about this. But what is your perception, and if you have any practice of doing open research, or we do with open research in general.\nA: I am, yeah. so again, just explain where I come from, I come from a culture of Copyleft culture. I have published most of the things that I have written before going to academia with Creative, Commons. And I have worked with people that have been very active in open source movement. So, when I entered academia, I was very familiar with, yeah, open methodology, with co-creation, with collaboration, with collective authorship. And also basically, with the idea that we are all doing collective authorship, like, I come from a political tradition that considers that knowledge is not of ever of one specific person, because what you know is always shaped by many other sources, and people and is, you know, your own interpretation and you - your own recombination of these things. Not that that makes what you're doing original. But it's always based on someone else's, you know, from the people that have, did you to speak [with] the people that have, you to think, to all the books that you have - that right? So all these, it's always like collective thinking. So this is my approach. So when I started the project, I wanted to have it on a platform, and I wanted to have it open from the beginning. So I have used something which is called, I was looking for different tools. I started thinking, I'm going to design my own website. Then again one of the principles also of open knowledge is produced, that it's already there, so don't try to, you know, reinvent the wheel every time, but, you know, like formats and and so structures that are there. So I started using this called Open Science framework on Open science framework is a platform, but precisely to do open research and collaborative research. Um, so I have everything there. That means that I have put my applications, to the grants are there, my whole confirmation is there. So whenever someone says \u201cHey Ana, can I take a look at your ethics application, which is super useful because we have no idea how to do these things, you know?\u201d And you go to a course, they give you an example. Maybe it's not at all what you're doing. So I learned a lot by other people, by reading to other people\u2019s applications, and you know, and presentations. So if you go to these, to this project, you could - anybody can download all the documents that I have produced that are more or less, that I finished, I don't have. But they have, like, the structure of the thesis that has been uploaded and this is where I'm going, where I will upload. Let's say the whole thesis with the chapters when they are finished\u2026", "next_question": "Hmm."}, {"text": "Q: \u2026as well as they're grant writing ones.

And so do you worry about your child getting the flu? Is it something you would you are concerned about, you know, you mentioned it's a seasonal thing, is it a thing you worry more about at certain times of the year?\nA: I'm certainly more awre of it in winter. But I think just a regular flu is something that we're all going to come into contact with with it in our daily lives. So, I mean, if I knew somebody was ill with a flu. I would avoid having to have contact with that person and but apart from that, I think, that I can't really protect him from but it's something that is going to get. And he's generally quite healthy little boy. So it's not something I worry about excessively for him because I think if you get if you get it its something that we can manage. We can care for him at home. I know what I would need to do in terms of like paracetamol and plenty of rest and hydration. And yeah, so I would say thats my level of concern about it. We've got elderly relatives that we live nearby and if [CHILD] were ill equally I wouldn't expose him to those relatives, for fear of him passing it on to them.

It's like specifically When a child gets sick with the flu?\nA: Well, I would expect him to have a high temperature and probably be quite lethargic, quite tired, maybe have a cough and some sinus involvement as well like blocked nose, and I would probably expect it to last at least a week and he wasn't getting any better after about 10 days than I would probably sort of seek some medical advice at that point. But other than that, if he was alright in himself and we were managing it at home than I wouldn't be inclided to do any more than that, like taking to a doctor or anything.", "next_question": "Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. Do you know anyone whose child has gotten sick with the flu or has [CHILD] gotten the flu before that you know of?"}, {"text": "Q: Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. Do you know anyone whose child has gotten sick with the flu or has [CHILD] gotten the flu before that you know of?\nA: I don't think he's had anything that I would call the flu. Now, he's certainly had like heavy colds and stuff butn hes never been taken down for any sort of an extended period oft time. And and I don't know if any other children like his little friends particularly that have had it.", "next_question": "Yeah. So when you want to learn more about a sickness, like the flu. Where do you go to find that information?"}, {"text": "Q: Um, so that actually sort of led me into my next question which is, have you ever talked to your child's GP or another healthcare professional about the flu and how it concerns your child?\nA: No, I can't say that I have directly, because I haven't ever had the need to.", "next_question": "Ya know that that makes sense. So my next set of questions, sort of help me learn your thoughts are on the vaccine and whether or not it's something hat you think could be helpful to [CHILD]. So what do you think the benefits are of having your child get the flu vaccine or are there any benefits to the flu vaccine?"}, {"text": "Q: Ya know that that makes sense. So my next set of questions, sort of help me learn your thoughts are on the vaccine and whether or not it's something hat you think could be helpful to [CHILD]. So what do you think the benefits are of having your child get the flu vaccine or are there any benefits to the flu vaccine?\nA: Yeah, well I mean flu vaccination is, something that I believe in and it is something that I would consider for him because obviously it's an unpleasant experience while he's young. And it can be avoided, so much the better. Um, just as I think it's quite frustrating for young children when they're ill. They can't fully understand what they need to do to recover and what you need to do to help them recover so they might be reluctant to take medicine, for example, or might be reluctant to rest or to drink as much as you might need them to and just I think prevention is better than cure. And if there's a chance for the vaccine would prevent him from getting flu than that's something that I would be in favor of", "next_question": "Yeah, absolutely. Um, what do you think the downsides are of having your child get the flu vaccine? or are there any downsides?"}, {"text": "Q: Yeah, absolutely. Um, what do you think the downsides are of having your child get the flu vaccine? or are there any downsides?\nA: Well I would be concerned about any side effects there might be. I've had information through from our GP practice for last sort of winter seasons flu vaccinations and that included some information around that. Um, but other than that life if he had some sort of allergic reaction to it of have any kind. But I can't receive a downside to vaccination", "next_question": "Yeah. Are there any like specific side effects that you worry about, or is it just a general like any side effects that might occur and kind of thing?"}, {"text": "Q: Yeah. Are there any like specific side effects that you worry about, or is it just a general like any side effects that might occur and kind of thing?\nA: I mean, at the time, um, of the flu vaccination being sort of released, last year we due to go on a holiday. So I was concerned that if he had the vaccination too close to us going away it might make him poorly. Because I understand that a vaccine can't give you the flu, it wont make you ill, but I was concerned about him, if his immune system was to be busy off reacting to the vaccine in the right ways, he might come down with something else, like a secondary thing. I would say that I haven't really got any other concerns about side effects or like downsides of it.", "next_question": "Sure. Yeah, that's great. Thank you. Um, so If you want to learn more about a vaccine, like, say you're, wondering whether [CHILD] needs one or about side effects, that kind of thing, where do you go to get that information?"}, {"text": "Q: Sure. Yeah, that's great. Thank you. Um, so If you want to learn more about a vaccine, like, say you're, wondering whether [CHILD] needs one or about side effects, that kind of thing, where do you go to get that information?\nA: Well, I would expect information really to be provided and when the vaccination was offered and that's been my experience with all vaccinations that he's had so far, like all of his childhood vaccinations, the routine ones. If I wasn't provided with information at the point of asking me to taking a vaccination and I would probably again look at the NHS website, maybe Or if I've been invited for vaccination for him at the practice, the GP practice, without any sort of supplementary information, then I would also request it from them.", "next_question": "Yeah, yeah, that, that makes sense. Have you ever talked to your child's GP or a home visitor, or any other medical professional about the flu vaccine specifically?"}, {"text": "Q: Yeah, yeah, that, that makes sense. Have you ever talked to your child's GP or a home visitor, or any other medical professional about the flu vaccine specifically?\nA: No, when we got invited for the flu vaccine last year I had all the information that I needed. So I didn't have any cause to seek better information about this. I haven't spoken to anybody about it.", "next_question": "Sure. Alright, so my next few questions questions are, I think you've, You've sort of answered it in a way, In the expression of ventures form, you mentioned that [CHILD] had not received the flu vaccine this year."}, {"text": "Q: Sure. Alright, so my next few questions questions are, I think you've, You've sort of answered it in a way, In the expression of ventures form, you mentioned that [CHILD] had not received the flu vaccine this year.\nA: Yeah", "next_question": "Yeah,so it sounds like that was because, based on what you just said, it sounds like it's because you were going away on holiday. Is that correct? You were going on holiday?."}]
