## Post-Interview Evaluation

### Emotional Progression
The candidate starts with a low stress score and a dominant emotion of "happy." However, as the interview progresses, the stress score slightly increases, and in the last recorded emotion, the dominant emotion shifts to "sad," with a significantly higher stress score. This suggests that the candidate may have become increasingly uncomfortable or unsure as the interview continued.

### Professionalism and Technical Depth
The candidate's answers are vague and repetitive ("Okay, I built the AI project"), lacking specific details. The initial code submission was empty. Therefore, the professionalism and technical depth are both **low**.

### VIKA's Adaptation
VIKA attempts to maintain a positive tone and provide encouragement to the candidate, even when their answers are unclear. VIKA also attempts to guide the candidate by asking for more specific information regarding their projects and the technologies they used.

### Final Verdict: Not Recommend

*   The candidate failed to provide concrete details about their technical skills or experience, resorting to vague and repetitive statements.
*   The initial code submission was empty, suggesting a potential lack of preparedness or understanding of the question.
*   The candidate's emotional state appears to deteriorate throughout the interview, possibly indicating a lack of confidence or discomfort with the questions asked.
