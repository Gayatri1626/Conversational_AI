## Post-Interview Evaluation

### Emotional Progression
The candidate appears to be consistently neutral throughout the interview, with a stress score of 0.0 at each recorded point. This indicates a calm and composed demeanor.

### Professionalism and Technical Depth
*   **LRU Cache:** The candidate provided no code, so technical skill is unknown.
*   **Version Control:** Candidate states they used it, but gives no details. Low technical depth.
*   **Resume Builder Project:** The candidate mentioned Flask, Gemini API, and NLP, but provided no detail about the implementation or specific challenges overcome. Spacy was the only library mentioned. Low technical depth.

### VIKA's Adaptability
VIKA attempts to guide the conversation with encouraging phrases ("Okay, that's a solid explanation. Let's keep the momentum going!") and builds on the candidate's answers by asking for more specific details. However, the questions remain relatively high-level, and there's no indication of VIKA increasing or decreasing the difficulty based on the candidate's performance.

### Final Verdict: Not Recommend
*   The candidate didn't provide code, making it impossible to assess coding skills.
*   The candidate's answers lacked depth and specific details regarding their technical skills.
*   There is no indication that the candidate's abilities meet an acceptable threshold for a recommendation.
