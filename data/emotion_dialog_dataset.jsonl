Let's keep going.\n\nCould you elaborate on the tools or libraries you favored during the data preprocessing stage?"}
{"candidate": "Sure. In a past project predicting customer churn, I had a feature for \"Customer Region\" with categories like North, South, East, and West. I chose one-hot encoding instead of label encoding because there was no inherent ordinal relationship between the regions. Label encoding could have introduced unintended hierarchy, which might mislead tree-based or distance-based models. One-hot ensured each category was treated equally.", "emotion": "neutral", "stress_score": 0.0, "difficulty": "medium", "vika_response": "Thanks for the clear explanation; that's a great example of feature encoding!\n\nCan you describe a situation where label encoding would be more appropriate than one-hot encoding?"}
{"candidate": "Absolutely. I usually start with handling missing values using imputation or removal, depending on the context. Then I encode categorical variables using one-hot or label encoding. I also apply feature scaling\u2014either normalization or standardization\u2014especially for distance-based models. Outlier detection, text cleaning, and feature engineering are also part of my standard preprocessing workflow", "emotion": "sad", "stress_score": 0.0, "difficulty": "medium", "vika_response": "I appreciate you sharing that thorough process; it sounds like you have a solid foundation!\n\nHow do you decide which features are most important for your model, and what techniques do you use for feature selection?"}
{"candidate": "Hi, I\u2019m Gayatri. I have one year of experience as a Software Developer, where I worked on building RESTful APIs using Flask and PostgreSQL.

Let's keep going!\n\nCan you describe a time when your monitoring system alerted you to a problem, and what steps did you take to diagnose and resolve it?"}
{"candidate": "Yes, once our monitoring dashboard showed a spike in response times on one of our APIs. I checked the logs and found a database query causing the delay.", "emotion": "anger", "stress_score": 0.65, "difficulty": "easy", "vika_response": "It sounds like you were really on top of identifying that issue quickly.

{"candidate": "\"Yes, in one project, a user search endpoint was taking over 2 seconds to respond. I profiled the queries and found a missing index in the PostgreSQL database.

Nicely done on optimizing the search endpoint.\n\nCould you elaborate on how you chose the right fields to index, and what trade-offs did you consider during that process?"}
