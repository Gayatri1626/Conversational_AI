I have published most of the things that I have written before going to academia with Creative, Commons. And I have worked with people that have been very active in open source movement. So, when I entered academia, I was very familiar with, yeah, open methodology, with co-creation, with collaboration, with collective authorship. And also basically, with the idea that we are all doing collective authorship, like, I come from a political tradition that considers that knowledge is not of ever of one specific person, because what you know is always shaped by many other sources, and people and is, you know, your own interpretation and you - your own recombination of these things. Not that that makes what you're doing original. But it's always based on someone else's, you know, from the people that have, did you to speak [with] the people that have, you to think, to all the books that you have - that right? So all these, it's always like collective thinking. So this is my approach. So when I started the project, I wanted to have it on a platform, and I wanted to have it open from the beginning. So I have used something which is called, I was looking for different tools. I started thinking, I'm going to design my own website. Then again one of the principles also of open knowledge is produced, that it's already there, so don't try to, you know, reinvent the wheel every time, but, you know, like formats and and so structures that are there. So I started using this called Open Science framework on Open science framework is a platform, but precisely to do open research and collaborative research. Um, so I have everything there. That means that I have put my applications, to the grants are there, my whole confirmation is there. So whenever someone says \u201cHey Ana, can I take a look at your ethics application, which is super useful because we have no idea how to do these things, you know?\u201d And you go to a course, they give you an example. Maybe it's not at all what you're doing. So I learned a lot by other people, by reading to other people\u2019s applications, and you know, and presentations. So if you go to these, to this project, you could - anybody can download all the documents that I have produced that are more or less, that I finished, I don't have. But they have, like, the structure of the thesis that has been uploaded and this is where I'm going, where I will upload. Let's say the whole thesis with the chapters when they are finished\u2026"

You know, even do the interview, take my notes, you know, write the notes how I feel them, you know, and transcribe them into these diagrams, and knowledge graphs, and then I present the knowledge graph to represent all the data that is behind this knowledge graph. It's not the same as quantitative data in the sense that I don't have, it's like, in order to make quantity qualitative available you have to go into explaining your own process of thinking, and your own process of analysis, which then is, of course, you know, like a good sign, this the method. But that's not, I think that that's not how everybody operates. Now, it's like, if you imagine that you are doing something which is more like historical analysis. um, so making because all these, that the qualitative data, in order to be also good for example, if I take the interviews, it's not enough to have the interviews. I will have to organize, you know, the title - who was there, when it was taken, what was the place, what is the context? Do a small summary of the text, and put hashtags? But these, that I do it in my head, and are increases you know, pieces of paper here and there, and, you know, a note here and note there if it needs [to be] done. It's not there already.

But in a project, in a bigger project, I think that there should be, like a work package, which is only about open access. And this is our package, it has its hours, and has its own money. The point is like, if you want it available, you have to know that this is, mmm, you know, like, time-consuming. But at the same time, when I was looking for platforms, not where to put the data because this is, you know, like okay, there is data, there is - there is different databases - and you could put the data there, but more, like, to have these, you know frameworks or displays, where you could follow these [indecipherable]. For example, open science framework, which is again a little bit dry, you know, so I, but I think will be also something that happens when, when, some of these places are emerging, is that my, only my interviews don't really amount to much, I mean, yeah, there [are], I don't know, 40, 50, final edited interviews is fine, but what we will need is a database of thousands of interviews, and it's difficult to visualise where this is, also if it's cluttered. So I think that a better planned platform, trained database, you know someone - that explains, or at least takes some more significant fields, or areas of interest and shows, now, but how this is available, how this is articulated, how this project that applied in this way and this method then had all these different, you know, like products available. I think this would be much more interesting. It would be interesting, also, for people, or for researchers, because you will be more aware that what you're doing is part of something bigger than you. And I think that still, and I'm like, I follow, you know, Twitter accounts that do, you know, like I work on open science and I follow it a little bit. I mean superexpert, but I follow it, and it's still, I feel like I am doing these out of, you know, like activism through the, this open thing with - partly it's\u2026"

It's not that I'm part of a, you know, very concrete project, with concrete people, but I'm part of a political project, a wider practice, political practice, and I'm trying to contribute to that as well. So, I'm trying to contribute to academic knowledge, but I'm trying to contribute to practice-based knowledge as well. So the only way to make these available and compatible with the principles of my political practice is to do it open source. I was doing Office before, and so, if I'm doing open culture and open, and working with open source, so it's only natural that then I do open science. But it is complicated, like I would like to, I would love to do everything much more open, but just like, first, you have to feed it. We've seen constraints in the university that are not thought to these, like, these things - University have to have the copyright. Like honestly, I have spent a number of emails asking \u201cWhy do you want the copyright?\u201d \u201cWhat happens if I do open access, you still need the copyright?\u201d So at the end, I presented the \u201830's application with no Copyright, because but nobody really was saying, \u201cYes, Ana, if you're doing this, then\u2026\u201d because they go on about open knowledge and open science, but at the same time, university wants to have the copyright - because they do want to have the right [to] commodify this knowledge. So honestly, like I am, this is, this is, we need a tension, not so much between my epistemic background and what I'm doing. But the tension is between and academic structure that has, you know, like one point - which might not be in qualitative data - because who the are ones like nobody's going to make money out of, you know, our interviews. But people are going to make money out of whatever, you know, like building structure, they want to put a patent on. Then again, this is for me, a little bit, you know, because I have agrant, that means that I'm getting money that is public, and actually yes, I see it's the months that's the research goes open source and open science so that they are asking actively researchers to publish their data sets and the results in open formats and open source. But for example, now there is this problem that - could that, would be about, for example, what do you do when you publish it? Because following this thing, your paper, or my papers, they will have to go to an open access format, but open access format will cost per thousand euros, but UK pounds."

And he's generally quite healthy little boy. So it's not something I worry about excessively for him because I think if you get if you get it its something that we can manage. We can care for him at home. I know what I would need to do in terms of like paracetamol and plenty of rest and hydration. And yeah, so I would say thats my level of concern about it. We've got elderly relatives that we live nearby and if [CHILD] were ill equally I wouldn't expose him to those relatives, for fear of him passing it on to them.

And it can be avoided, so much the better. Um, just as I think it's quite frustrating for young children when they're ill. They can't fully understand what they need to do to recover and what you need to do to help them recover so they might be reluctant to take medicine, for example, or might be reluctant to rest or to drink as much as you might need them to and just I think prevention is better than cure.

Because I understand that a vaccine can't give you the flu, it wont make you ill, but I was concerned about him, if his immune system was to be busy off reacting to the vaccine in the right ways, he might come down with something else, like a secondary thing.

So I rang back in a week or so it's time and they still havent had the vaccines, and we kind of played this kind of tennis for a few weeks in the run up to the holiday and then really, we got too close to the holidays. And as I mentioned, I was concerned about having a negative effect on his health for the holiday. And then after that we were into November, and I thought, you know what, like It's winter now. By the time you got the vaccine them through the practice. And then, you know, I kind of felt like we were there without already. And it was a bit too late by that point.

        "text": "Yeah, um, however, you know, theres some fault on my part, I guess you could say. Because once we were back from holiday and back into working routines and stuff like that. I didn't get back on to it in the way that I should have. And the chances are that once they had the vaccines in the practice that it wouldn't, it wouldn't have been a problem. Its just that when I wanted it, it wasn't there, if that makes sense."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Interviewer",
        "text": "Ya know that that certainly makes sense to me. Thats really good, thank you. So my last kind of few questions are just to help me learn about your thoughts around like vaccination as a whole."

        "speaker": "Candidate",
        "text": "Yeah, yeah."

      {
        "speaker": "Interviewer",
        "text": "Yeah, can you explain how you decided that he should receive those vaccinations?"
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Candidate",
        "text": "Um, I just think that, the vaccinations, they're important. I think the diseases they protect against whilst they're you know, really very low in this country, if not, you know, kind of really apparent at all, pockets of them do occur. And when they do theyre dangerous. And and the vaccinations have been, you know, running for a long while now and and I think that um you know they're tried and tested and that they're important. And I know some people think, \"well everybody else's vaccinated so much so my child is vaccinated kind of by proxy\" I'm not, I'm not a believer in that. And so I thought it was important that he received all of them. I myself am a practitioner, Imteacher in and working with children with autism. I know that theres a lot around the MMR vaccination and links with that, that still prevail, even though that has been disproven. And so I do believe that the vaccinations are important and are there for a reason and we were invited for them. He had them."

        "text": "There you go. Thank you. Um, have you personally had the flu vaccine this year?"
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Candidate",
        "text": "I haven't had it this year. And again, that was an issue with supply. I went for one. Being kind of classed as a keyworker from working with a vulnerable people I can claim the cost of a flu vaccination through my employer. So it wouldn't be something that I'd pay for. But the pharmacies locally that I went to for flu vaccination were only providing ones for vulnerable categories. So the over 65 and those who get them for free. And so I had a problem getting one for myself, so I didn't get one this year. It wasn't for the want of trying, yeah."

        "speaker": "Candidate",
        "text": "Yeah, yeah, yeah."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Interviewer",
        "text": "So that's actually the last of my questions. So is there, I like to close on, Is there anything else about the flu or the flu vaccination, or just vaccination in general. Really, anything. I didn't ask about that you'd like to speak to?"
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Candidate",
        "text": "Ah no, no I don't think there is that I think. But I mean, I guess I can get back to you by email if I think of anything else, I think, important."
